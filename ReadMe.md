# This is the public repository for a course taught at the Pittsburgh Gifted Center
# Annual Goal:
We, given the 7th and 8th Grades Common Core Standards for Humanities, will use higher-level thinking (Analysis; Synthesis; Evaluation) while interacting effectively with peers to develop self-directed learning skills (Creating plan; Taking action; Evaluating the result) to complete projects reflecting academic strengths and interests.

# STLOs:
We, in Gamified Pasts, will apply higher-level thinking processes to determine the historical circumstances that have led to the formation of new social groups. 

We, in Gamified Pasts, will apply interaction and higher-level thinking processes to contextualize historical decisions and develop arguments that support or oppose historical actions. 

We, in Gamified Pasts, will apply creative and higher-level thinking processes to examine and derive mechanisms that guide historical and current circumstances. 

We, in Gamified Pasts, will apply decision making and self-directed learning processes to develop interactive representations of real-world events based on appropriate game theory and mechanics.
